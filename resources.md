This page will eventually have links to resources that students might find useful.

At the moment, I'm testing whether it's possible to create functional anchor tags within a single page. So, for now, here are two links (note that I'm using <a href="http://doctoripsum.com/">doctoripsum.com</a> for the layout text):

<h2>Introductory</h2>

No, not the hugging. I'm against the hugging. Do you wanna come with me? 'Cause if you do, then I should warn you — you're gonna see all sorts of things. Ghosts from the past. Aliens from the future. The day the Earth died in a ball of flame. It won't be quiet, it won't be safe, and it won't be calm. But I'll tell you what it will be: The trip of a lifetime! 'Timey' what? 'Timey wimey'? It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezzes are cool. He was dead already, I'm saving us. Follow me, and run! This stuff, or whoever sent it, is cleverer than we are. Unfortunate, isn't it?

The Hand of Omega is called that because Time Lords have an infinite capacity for pretension. It's rather a pity, in a way...now the universe is down to 699 wonders. What? What?! WHAT?! People assume that time is a strict progression of cause-and-effect... but actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly... timey-wimey... stuff. Your hips are fine, you're built like a man! Geronimo! Well, I would say that that person would be an egomaniac, need, game-player sort of person.

Sorry, I'm going to have to relieve you of your pet. Shut up, I was talking to the horse. Your hips are fine, you're built like a man! Do try and keep out of my way in future and in past, there's a good fellow. The time continuum should be big enough for the both of us. The thing is, Adam, time travel is like visiting Paris. You can't just read the guidebook, you've got to throw yourself in! Eat the food, use the wrong verbs, get charged double and end up kissing complete strangers! Or is that just me?

Shut up, K-9! Why can't you leave me alone?! Powerful! Crush the lesser races! Conquer the galaxy! UNIMAGINABLE POWER! UNLIMITED RICE PUDDING! Et cetera! Et cetera! I don't have a future. The Time Lords are an immensely civilised race. We can control our own environment - we can live forever, barring accidents, and we have the secret of space/time travel. Let's go in! Come along, Pond! There are some corners of the universe which have bred the most terrible things. Things which act against everything we believe in. They must be fought.

Kidneys! I have kidneys. And I don't like the colour. I might've been saying something important. I was saying something important! I think you need a doctor. But it was a childish dream that made you a doctor. You dreamed you could hold back death. Isn't that true? It all started out as a mild curiosity in the junkyard, and now it's turned out to be quite a great spirit of adventure. Bow ties are cool. Rose... before I go, I just want to tell you: you were fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. And do you know what? So was I!

Smith. Doctor John Smith. The Time Lords are an immensely civilised race. We can control our own environment - we can live forever, barring accidents, and we have the secret of space/time travel. That could blow a hole in the space-time continuum, the size of—actually, the exact size of Belgium. That's a bit undramatic, isn't it? 'Belgium'? Reverse the polarity of… Are you capable of speaking without flapping your hands about? Run. There's always something to look at if you open your eyes! Don't be lasagna.

Oh my word! Do you have to talk like children? What is it that makes you so ashamed of being a grown-up? You can spend the rest of your life with me, but I can't spend the rest of mine with you. I have to live on. Alone. That's the curse of the Time Lords. Overconfidence, this, and a small screwdriver. I’m absolutely sorted. Usually called 'The Doctor.' Or 'The Caretaker.' Or 'Get off this planet.' Though, strictly speaking, that probably isn't a name. Planets come and go. Stars perish. Matter disperses, coalesces, forms into other patterns, other worlds. Nothing can be eternal.

One day, just one day, maybe I'll meet somebody who gets the whole 'don't wander off' thing. Our lives are important—at least to us—as we see, so we learn…Our destiny is in the stars , so let's go and search for it. He thinks I'm a charlatan, my Dear. Once upon a time. The end. Dad skills. You were expecting someone else? Well, you're very similar heights. Maybe you should wear labels. Oh, my giddy aunt! Underneath it all I think you're probably kind and nice, and very brave. I just wish you weren't a soldier.

People assume that time is a strict progression of cause-and-effect... but actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly... timey-wimey... stuff. You don't understand so you find excuses. Oh, my giddy aunt! Goodbye... Fancypants! Allons-y! Renewed? Have I? That's it, I've been renewed. It's part of the TARDIS. Without it I couldn't survive. Hello-o-o-o. How can you miss me? I'm easy to find. I'm the guy with two hearts, remember? When I say run, run. ...RUN!

The least important things, sometimes my dear boy, lead to the greatest discoveries. A knight of the GRAND ORDER OF OBERON! Only I would be stupid enough to attack such a person! Dreams are important…never underestimate them. I don't know. But I'd probably blame the English. Small though it is, the human brain can be quite effective when working at full efficiency, not unlike myself! Can I talk about planets now? That could blow a hole in the space-time continuum, the size of—actually, the exact size of Belgium. That's a bit undramatic, isn't it? 'Belgium'?

I am totally against bantering. Do try and keep out of my way in future and in past, there's a good fellow. The time continuum should be big enough for the both of us. I can't stand burnt toast. I loathe bus stations. Terrible places. Full of lost luggage and lost souls. Butterfingers. Reverse the polarity of the neutron flow. As we learn about each other, so we learn about ourselves. Don't you think she looks tired? Butterfingers. Goodbye... Fancypants! There are worlds out there where the sky is burning, and the sea's asleep, and the rivers dream; people made of smoke and cities made of song. Somewhere there's danger, somewhere there's injustice, and somewhere else the tea's getting cold. Come on, Ace. We've got work to do.

Well Kangs, I must say, there's no place like home... and this is no place like home. My personal plan is that a thing will probably happen quite soon. Jamie, remind me to give you a lesson in tying knots, sometime. Eh? Doctor who? What's he talking about…? I was being chased by a giant dinosaur, but I think I've managed to give it the slip. Oh, you've got a dinosaur too! Aw, I wanted to be ginger! I've never been ginger! And you, Rose Tyler! Fat lot of good you were! You gave up on me! Ooh, that's rude. Is that the sort of man I am now? Am I rude? Rude and not ginger.
