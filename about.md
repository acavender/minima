## About the course

This course is designed to introduce students to some of the fundamental questions and issues of politics. We will begin by asking what questions should be considered “political,” and why they should be thought of as political questions.

We will not, however, spend the entire semester in theorizing. Politics is a practical science, and we will consider the real-world implications of some of our provisional answers to fundamental political questions, focusing on current political issues.

## Learning outcomes

By the end of the semester, students will have:
* explored some important political issues,
* developed an understanding of those issues,
* begun to develop positions on those issues, and be able to defend those positions,
* developed their analytical and writing skills, and
* learned some computing, research, and information management skills that will benefit them in their future studies and careers.

In the course of our exploration of the issues chosen for this semester, students will also learn how to ask appropriate questions, such as:
* What is the issue at hand?
* How should we understand or frame the issue?
* What assumptions underlie competing approaches to the issue?
* What are the central questions involved?
* What kind(s) of evidence would help us begin to answer our questions?
* Where might we look for such evidence?

As students work to accomplish these objectives through their participation in class and their completion of assignments, they will also meet some of the broader goals of the Sophia Program in Liberal Learning. We will focus particularly on:

### Social Science I LO1 outcomes:
* A Saint Mary’s student identifies and explains social science concepts and theories about human behavior, systems, and cultures.
* A Saint Mary’s student applies social science concepts and theories in her analysis of human behavior, systems, and cultures.
* A Saint Mary’s student recognizes and explains effects of diversity and equity in specific areas such as class, race, religion, age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, and/or privilege.

Each of these skills is developed through careful reading of, reflection on, discussion of, and writing about the course materials.

### LO2 outcomes in writing:

|**LO2**|**Writing Program Outcomes**|

| A Saint Mary's student demonstrates basic information literacy skills as listed in the information literacy sub-outcomes. (She is able to determine how much and what kind of information she needs, locate that information, evaluate its suitability, and use it to accomplish her purpose.)| Students fulfill this outcome by completing the article review and research essay assignments.|
| A Saint Mary's student demonstrates effective oral communication in presentational or interactive contexts.| Students fulfill this outcome by regular participation in class discussions and by presentation of their research work.|
