# Learning outcomes

By the end of the semester, students will have:
* explored some important political issues,
* developed an understanding of those issues,
* begun to develop positions on those issues, and be able to defend those positions,
* developed their analytical and writing skills, and
* learned some computing, research, and information management skills that will benefit them in their future studies and careers.

In the course of our exploration of the issues chosen for this semester, students will also learn how to ask appropriate questions, such as:
* What is the issue at hand?
* How should we understand or frame the issue?
* What assumptions underlie competing approaches to the issue?
* What are the central questions involved?
* What kind(s) of evidence would help us begin to answer our questions?
* Where might we look for such evidence?

As students work to accomplish these objectives through their participation in class and their completion of assignments, they will also meet some of the broader goals of the Sophia Program in Liberal Learning. We will focus particularly on:

## Social Science I LO1 outcomes:
* A Saint Mary’s student identifies and explains social science concepts and theories about human behavior, systems, and cultures.
* A Saint Mary’s student applies social science concepts and theories in her analysis of human behavior, systems, and cultures.
* A Saint Mary’s student recognizes and explains effects of diversity and equity in specific areas such as class, race, religion, age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, and/or privilege.
