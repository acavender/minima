## Updated location for transcript of Prof. Lessig's talk

The site I originally pointed you to for a transcript of "Aaron's Law: Law and Justice in a Digital Age" seems to be down.

Here's [another site that also has the transcript](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2013/03/transcript-lawrence-lessig-on-aarons-laws-law-and-justice-in-a-digital-age-section-i.html), in case you wish to reference it. The [second half of the transcript](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2013/03/transcript-lawrence-lessig-on-aarons-laws-law-and-justice-in-a-digital-age-section-ii.html) (the previous link has only the first half of the talk) was posted separately the following day.
