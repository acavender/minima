## W Survey

This post is an invitation to you.

Each semester, the W progam surveys students at the beginning and end of the semester. The surveys are short; each has only three questions.

At the beginning of the semester, students are asked to assess their strengths as writers and their areas for improvement, and to identify the aspects of their writing that they'd most like to work on. At the end of the semester, they're invited to reflect on their progress over the previous few months.

Filling out the survey is *entirely voluntary*. It's intended to help you reflect on your own skills as a writer, and it's also used for ongoing assessment of the W Program. It is *not* used for assessing student work.

If you choose to complete the survey, you'll be invited to complete a followup survey in early December. That survey will invite you to reflect on your growth and development as a writer over the course of the semester.

[The survey](https://goo.gl/forms/flS7PxhcWyvaa4gU2) is now available if you wish to participate. I'll leave it open until 5:00 pm on Friday, August 31. Please note that you'll need to be logged in to your Saint Mary's Google account to access the survey form.
