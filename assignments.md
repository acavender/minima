## Assignments and grading

### Assignments

#### Writing assignments:

All will be assessed based on content and on how well they demonstrate the [LO2 outcomes in writing](/about).

##### Out-of-class essays:

* Potok (including a draft and revision): **100** points
* Framing the News: **100** points
* Article Review: **150** points
* Research essay (including a draft and revision): **150** points

##### In-class essays:

* Three at 75 points each; the lowest score will be dropped: **150** points

#### Other assignments:

* Twelve quizzes at 20 points each; the lowest two will be dropped: **200** points
* Completed portfolio, including a revision narrative: **150** points

*There is no final examination in this course.*

I expect assignments to be submitted on time. Occasionally, however, there are good reasons why this is not possible. In such cases, an extension may be reasonable, but it must be negotiated with me ***at least twenty-four hours in advance of the deadline***. Unless you’ve negotiated an extension with me, a late essay will be reduced by 10% if it’s submitted within a week of the original deadline, and by 20% if it’s submitted between one and two weeks late. After two weeks, the essay will no longer receive credit, but you must still submit it.

No extra credit is available. ***You must submit all out-of-class essays in order to pass the course.***

### Grading

Final grades will be calculated as follows:

A = 930-1000, A- = 900-929, B+ = 880-889, B = 830-879, B- = 800-829, C+ = 780-789, C = 730-779, C- = 700-729, D = 600-699, F = < 600
