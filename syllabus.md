All critical syllabus information is linked below. A [PDF version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JAVVzcbKItwZaJZ09BVMJI7JAXh-1cxr/view?usp=sharing) of the syllabus is available for download if you prefer to have something you can print out. Keep in mind, however, that there may be some adjustments to the course as the semester progresses, and the PDF will not be updated. If there is ever a discrepancy between the PDF and this website, the site takes precedence.
