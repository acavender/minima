## Texts

You’ll need two books for this course:

* Potok, Chaim. 1997. *In the Beginning*. New York: Ballantine Books.
* Scott, Gregory, and Stephen M Garrison. 2016. *The Political Science Student Writer’s Manual and Reader’s Guide*. 8th edition. Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield.

Both are available in e-book format, and if you prefer to manage your books electronically, that’s perfectly acceptable[^1]. Paper copies are available in the bookstore for your convenience.

All other texts for this course are available online or via the library.

## Tools

You’ll need access to a word processing application (e.g., Microsoft Word, Apple Pages, LibreOffice Writer, Google Documents) and the ability to create PDFs from the documents you create.

During the semester, we’ll also be making use of [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) to manage and share bibliographic resources. Zotero is available for Mac, Windows, and Linux. It won’t run on a Chromebook, though Chromebook users can access their Zotero libraries through the web interface.


[^1]:	This means that I have no objection to the use of computers and tablets in the classroom. There is, however, an obligation to use them responsibly, in a way that distracts neither you nor those around you. I reserve the right to ask that a device be put away if I have reason to think it’s being used for anything other than work for our class.
