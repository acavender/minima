## Course policies

### Accessibility/students with disabilities

It’s important to me that all students have the opportunity to learn and to succeed in this course.

Accordingly, I do my best to make all materials in this course accessible to all students. If you have trouble accessing any course materials, please let me know as soon as possible so we can work together to resolve the situation.

If you have had documented academic adjustments (accommodations) in the past, or think you may be eligible for them presently, you should contact Iris Giamo ([igiamo@saintmarys.edu](mailto:igiamo@saintmarys.edu)) or Jennifer Wright ([jwright@saintmarys.edu](mailto:jwright@saintmarys.edu)) in the Disabilities Resource Office (DRO), Madeleva 103C, to make an appointment to address this matter. The DRO is responsible for coordinating academic accommodations for students each semester and will issue a letter of documentation to your faculty for the current semester. Requests for such accommodations will not be honored without this letter from the DRO. Securing reasonable accommodations requires timely action on the part of the student. Please contact the staff in the DRO for an appointment to discuss how we will implement your accommodations.

### Attendance

Come to class! Come on time!

When you miss a class or any portion thereof, you cheat yourself out of both the material presented and your colleagues’ contributions to class discussion. You also cheat your colleagues of *your* contributions to the class session. Late arrivals to class are disruptive (they’re also *occasionally* unavoidable — sometimes life happens — but late arrivals should be rare).

There are times, however, when other obligations rightly take priority over a particular class session:

* If you are ill with anything more serious than a mild to moderate cold, please don’t come to class. You will recover more quickly if you stay home (and you’ll avoid spreading the illness to the rest of us).
* If you have religious commitments that require you to miss class, please let me know in advance, and we’ll make any necessary arrangements.
* Family emergencies are important and warrant your time and attention. Don’t hesitate to attend to them as needed.[^1]

This list is illustrative, not exhaustive. In any case, please be courteous and let me know when you must miss class, in advance if at all possible. *Remember that you are responsible for all material covered in class, whether you are present or not.*

Because you are adults, I expect you to be capable of making good decisions about when to come to class and when there’s good reason to miss, and I trust your judgment. Accordingly, I neither take attendance into account when calculating your semester grade nor demand documentation for absences, with one exception: as a matter of courtesy to your colleagues, you ***must*** be present for all research presentations. Missing a research presentation class without a legitimate, verifiable reason will result in a 20-point deduction from your semester total.

### Class cancellation

If I need to unexpectedly cancel a class meeting due to illness or some other serious reason, I will make every effort to notify you via email prior to class time.

If I am not in the classroom and you have received no notice of a cancellation, please wait ten minutes before concluding that something has happened and I’ve been unable to inform you.

### Academic integrity

Academic inquiry always involves conversation. Sometimes that conversation is verbal; at other times, it takes written form. Whatever form it takes, academic conversation at its best enables us all to learn from each other. The proper citation of one’s sources is an important way of engaging conversation partners who aren’t physically present. Plagiarism makes use of our conversation partners’ ideas without acknowledging their contribution; it robs them of their voice.

It is this failure to acknowledge and involve conversation partners that makes plagiarism the most serious academic offense a student or faculty member can commit. It is the passing off of another’s ideas or words as one’s own; in effect, it is theft. It also undercuts the trust that is essential in any community of learning. The plagiarist shows disrespect not only for those from whom she steals and for those to whom she presents the plagiarized work, but also for herself. She is, in effect, saying that she is incapable of doing her own work, or that she is too lazy to acknowledge others involved in the conversation.

For all of these reasons, Saint Mary’s College maintains an [academic honesty policy](http://www3.saintmarys.edu/first-year-policies). Accordingly, I treat incidents of plagiarism very seriously. At minimum, a student whose work is discovered to be plagiarized will fail the assignment in question. Truly egregious or repeated instances of plagiarism may result in failure for the course, not just the assignment. In keeping with the College’s policy, I will report instances of plagiarism to Academic Affairs.

We will be working together this semester to ensure that everyone in the class is aware of what plagiarism is and is familiar with how to document sources correctly. (Problems with citation style and/or formatting do not constitute plagiarism. I will point out such problems and help you correct them, but as long as, when you’ve borrowed words or ideas from someone else, you indicate that and point to the source from which you’ve borrowed, you have not plagiarized.) Both our own [Writing Center](https://www.saintmarys.edu/writing-center) and the [Purdue Online Writing Lab (OWL)](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/purdue_owl.html) are excellent resources, and can provide you with assistance in developing your writing skills as well as assistance with proper documentation. If ever you are in doubt as to whether your paper contains plagiarized elements, please ask prior to submitting it. Given reasonable advance notice, I am always happy to go over a draft with you, and to answer any questions you might have about how to cite your sources properly. Never let the pressures of academia lead you into dishonesty. Character, self-respect, and the enjoyment of good conversation are far more important than what may seem more immediately obvious measures of success.
