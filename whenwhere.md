## Class meetings

We meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9:30-10:45, and on Wednesdays from 9:00-9:50. All class meetings, unless otherwise announced, are in Spes Unica 135.

## Contact information and office hours

Though I’m reachable by phone at x4430, the most reliable way to reach me is by email at [acavende@saintmarys.edu](mailto:acavende@saintmarys.edu).

I check email Monday through Friday, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. I make every effort to respond within one business day. Please note that I don’t check work email on the weekends, so I won’t see an email sent on Friday afternoon until Monday morning.

My usual office hours are 10:00-12:00 on Mondays and Wednesdays, and 11:00-12:00 on Tuesdays and Thursdays. These are drop-in hours; except during the advance registration period, you don’t need an appointment during these times.

If my usual hours don’t work for you, I’m happy to make alternate arrangements. Feel free to stop by the office to see if I’m in and it’s a good time; if it isn’t, we can arrange a time that works for both of us. Alternately, bring your calendar to class and we’ll set something up. If you use Google Calendar, my free/busy times are visible to everyone at Saint Mary’s, and you’re welcome to make an appointment on your calendar and invite me to the meeting.
