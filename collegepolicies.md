## College policies

The following are important policies to be aware of. It’s my sincere hope that neither you nor your friends will have any need to make use of any of the resources mentioned below, but it’s useful to know where to go for help when needed.

### Sexual assault

Any student who has experienced sexual assault, relationship violence, and/or stalking is encouraged to contact the Belles Against Violence Office (phone 284-4081, email [kjohnson@saintmarys.edu](mailto:kjohnson@saintmarys.edu)), for general guidance. The following two Saint Mary’s departments have confidential staff: (1) Campus Ministry (pastoral ministers) and (2) Health & Counseling (professional staff). If your experience is directly impacting your academic performance, you may also consider contacting the Office of Academic Affairs (121 Le Mans Hall, phone 284-4594) for assistance with academic issues (but note that they are not confidential staff). Please know that, should you come to me or share personal experiences through the class, excluding through certain kinds of written assignments such as journals, I am required to report any sexual misconduct incident/complaint to a Title IX Coordinator. He or she will contact you to let you know about accommodations and support services at Saint Mary’s and possibilities for holding accountable the person who harmed you. Depending on information shared in a report, Saint Mary’s may have a federal obligation to investigate the incident. If you do not wish to have your incident or complaint reported or are uncertain whether you want to file a report, contact any of the three confidential resources listed above. Each of them can offer support services and discuss reporting options.

### Discriminatory harassment

Saint Mary’s College is committed to upholding standards that promote respect and human dignity in an environment that fosters academic excellence and professionalism.

As a student, if you experience what you believe to be discrimination or harassment by another member of the Saint Mary’s community because of your identity based on sex, race, color, national origin, religion, age, disability, citizenship status, genetic information, veteran status or any other characteristic protected by the law, or your sexual or political orientation, PLEASE REPORT THAT BEHAVIOR.

Allegations of discrimination and harassment should be reported on the Bias Reporting Form on the portal: [https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?SaintMarysCollege](https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?SaintMarysCollege). Please take a few minutes to review the SMC policy Prohibiting Discriminatory Harassment Against Students at: [https://goo.gl/Eg4CDj](https://goo.gl/Eg4CDj)

Should you wish to talk to a confidential resource on campus please contact Health and Counseling in Angela at 574-284-4805 or Campus Ministry in Regina Hall at 574-284-5391.
